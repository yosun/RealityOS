RealityOS lets people turn the world itself into software.

Point a camera at a real object and it becomes interactive. Load the same application into a 3D world and it becomes simulatable. The app doesn’t change — only the world it runs in does. Gemini 3 makes this possible by understanding images, inferring intent, and continuously adapting application behavior as it moves between reality and simulation.

With RealityOS, applications are no longer confined to screens. They run directly on the real world — and just as easily inside virtual ones. Creation happens through interaction — not syntax.

🧠 RealityOS — Reality Assembly Language (.rsl)

System Intent
RealityOS turns the physical world into an executable program.
.rsl (Reality Assembly Language) is the canonical state of that program.

⸻

🧩 Core Model
	•	An input image is source memory.
	•	Segmentation produces object instances.
	•	Each object instance becomes a register.
	•	Registers connect to operations.
	•	Operations execute in explicit sequence.
	•	Time is the program counter.

RealityOS is a virtual machine for reality.


🗂️ Registers (Objects)
	•	Every segmented object is a register.
	•	Each register has a stable, opaque ID.
	•	The register ID is analogous to a memory address.
	•	Geometry binds the register to reality.
	•	Names are symbolic and editable.

Law:

Identity comes from geometry, not language.


🔗 Wiring (Data + Control)
	•	Connections between registers and operations are explicit.
	•	Connections may represent:
	•	dataflow
	•	controlflow
	•	annotation
	•	Wires are visible in 2D and spatially arced in 3D.
	•	Wiring expresses causality.

⸻

⏱️ Time (Schedule)
	•	Every operation has an explicit execution order.
	•	Order defines causality.
	•	The timeline is editable, scrub-able, and replayable.
	•	Time is not inferred — it is authored.

Law:

Nothing happens “implicitly”.


🧠 Intelligence Boundary
	•	Language models:
	•	translate user intent into segmentation instructions
	•	suggest symbolic names and affordances
	•	Language models never define geometry.
	•	Geometry always comes from segmentation.
	•	RealityOS mediates meaning ↔ matter.

⸻

🧪 Refinement
	•	Users can correct reality directly:
	•	foreground/background clicks
	•	region constraints
	•	Refinement updates geometry without breaking register identity.
	•	Human correction is preferred over hallucination.

⸻

🎛️ Modes
	•	Inspect: explore registers and metadata
	•	Refine: correct segmentation
	•	Wire: connect registers and operations
	•	Timeline: author sequence and causality
	•	Split: simultaneous 2D and 3D views


📦 .rsl Program

A .rsl file contains:
	•	source image
	•	register table
	•	operation list
	•	wiring graph
	•	execution schedule
	•	view state

.rsl is:
	•	serializable
	•	replayable
	•	portable
	•	executable
